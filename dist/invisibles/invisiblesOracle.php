Involve the reader in the whole process by making him/her realize that she/to can join/has already joined the ranks of The Invisibles.

	The idea is that the original desire, reduced to abstraction, can be more easily implanted into the subconscious mind, there to do its work. When creating sigils it's best to start with very specific desires that have at least some likelihood of success. Performing magic has a lot to do with the arrangement of apparent coincidences and providing pathways along which desires can travel or, to put it in more basic terms, there's little point in sigilizing for a lottery win if you don't also buy a lottery ticket.   <br />
