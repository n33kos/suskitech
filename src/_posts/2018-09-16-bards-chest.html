			Greetings traveler! You have stumbled upon the wreckage of a caravan plundered by savages. Nearby the body of a wealthy looking bard you find a chest but there is no key in sight. Perhaps there is another way to get the treasure within...
		</p>
		<h3>Controls:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Left & Right arrows spin the lock
			</li>
			<li>
				Mouse or touch will also spin the lock
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			<h3>Details:</h3>
			Bard's Chest is a Web Audio API game with support for all major browsers excluding IE11 and lower (If you are still using internet explorer, knock that nonsense off). The goal is to catch sound waves on different sides of the bard's lock to play the correct unlock sequence, releasing the treasure within!
