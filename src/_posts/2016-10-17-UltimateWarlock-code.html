			You are a shifty warlock seeking ultimate power but the witches and wizards are the ones who hold the secrets of spellcraft. Traverse the land blasting enemies to steal magical spells, increasing your power until you are the Ultimate Warlock!

			Ultimate Warlock is a gameboy style fantasy roguelike shooter game written in LOVE engine. This project was made as an entry for the itch.io GBJAM5 game jam. The goal was to create a game with the limitations of an orignal gameboy within 7 days.
